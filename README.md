## vps

Scripts used for managing/restarting processes on my VPS.

This is currently hosted on scaleway, though it should be OS/provider agnostic.

Uses [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) to run background processes. (Currently using screen version 4.08.02 23-Oct-17)

Jikan is setup using [this](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/docker-jikan)
